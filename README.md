This project is an API automation testing framework built using Playwright, Cucumber (BDD), and JavaScript.
It provides a structured, maintainable, and scalable approach for testing RESTful APIs, validating responses in JSON/XML, and generating detailed HTML reports.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Playwright API testing – leveraging the request API from Playwright
✅ Cucumber (BDD) – readable test scenarios in Gherkin format
✅ Data-driven testing using JSON or environment variables
✅ Reusable step definitions for common API operations
✅ HTML Reports for clear and shareable test results
✅ Environment-based configuration (QA, Stage, Prod)
✅ Tag-based test execution
✅ Automatic screenshot & log capture on failure (optional)

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
